Since cybersecurity will be the main focus of almost everyone who uses internet via desktop, mobile, IoT, wireless etc., switched career paths to becoming an Ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester   

For the past 25+ years had worked in Electronic Design Automation industry, focused on software testing, risk analysis, infrastructure, and web application development. I designed and developed an iOS app, also developed web applications to support the iOS app as well a personal real estate. I tested and fixed vulnerabilities on these sites: specfically, login access, Cross Site Scripting, Cookies & session Management, and SQL manipulation. It never occurred to me that I was penetration testing my own sites to be free of cyber threats.  

I am very passionate to continuously learn new technologies, so I completed **certifications, training, research** in Certified Ethical Hacking (V12) Specialization, Google Cloud Cybersecurity, GenAI LLM, Deep Learning Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Data Sciences.  

Improved penetration testing skills using cybersecurity tools: Kali-Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, ZAP, etc. pretrained [GenAI LLM Models](https://github.com/jayc279/GenAI_LLM) and researched Deep Neural Networks & Machine Learning Models documented in [Kaggle Notebooks](https://github.com/jayc279/kaggle_notebooks).  

**Warning:** This repository may contain flows, methodologies, processes, procedures that worked for me, does not mean will work for all. Read with an open mind...  

**This respository documents the learnings, Hacking related work, projects, bug bounties, etc.** related to Penetration Testing.  
*Note:* Everything documented/written here are either **my learnings** from the internet -or- if related to a **client** it is with their **express permission**  

### Setting up Penetration Testing and Vulnerable machines
This took me a long time to figure out, remember, what works for me may not work for you. If you search the web for input on what is the *best setup for penetration testing*, agree this is an opended ended question to ask, you can tailor it to suit your machine.  

If you already own a laptop (check the recommendations in the link below to see if it meets the requirements) later you can switch to min-pc -or- pc -or- VPS). For a full report, access [Penetration Testing Setup](https://github.com/jayc279/CEH/setup-for-penetration-testing.md)
